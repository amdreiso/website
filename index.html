          <h1>Programming</h1>
          <p>I began programming in 2019, when a brazilian youtuber I used to watch made a video making a game in Gamemaker Studio 2</p>
          <p>that sparked an interest in me and made me realize I could also make games</p>
          <p>So I downloaded the free trial of Gamemaker(probably have over 5 accounts just for that) and kept watching tutorials, all of my games were trash and I gave up more times than I can remember</p>
          <p>But I kept trying, and through a disgusting process of not wanting to learn anything new and keep using if statements for everything, I can say I'm pretty good at it now. Even though I don't have any games to show off LOL.</p>
          <br>
          <p>But recently I've been programming in C, python, lua, unfortunately javascript, gml (the Gamemaker language) and some java</p>
          <p>I want to learn rust and go, go seems easier, and rust seems like death</p>
